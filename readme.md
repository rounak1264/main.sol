# Staking Rewards for Funding Scholarships

## Project Description

The "Staking Rewards for Funding Scholarships" project enables individuals to stake tokens and earn rewards, which are then used to fund scholarships for students in need. The platform uses a decentralized smart contract to manage staking, reward distribution, and the creation of a scholarship fund.

By participating in staking, users not only earn passive rewards, but they also contribute to a charitable cause. The scholarship funds can be used to support educational opportunities for underprivileged students, making the platform a blend of finance and philanthropy.
